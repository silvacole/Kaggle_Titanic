# Kaggle_Titanic

This file is my first attempt at a Kaggle competition. I looked at the famous Titanic dataset and built a ML model to predict which passengers did and didn't survive. I chose to use Random Forests as my model, since I felt this fit this situation best. I began with some basic data anlysis, moved into data cleaning, and finished by building and testing the model.
