# Kaggle_Titanic

This file is my first attempt at a Kaggle competition. I looked at the famous Titanic dataset and built some ML models to predict which passengers did and didn't survive. I chose to use Random Forests as my first model, since I felt this fit this situation best. I then used a DNN model using Python's Tensorflow library as my second model. For each file, I began with some basic data anlysis, moved into data cleaning, and finished by building and testing the model.
